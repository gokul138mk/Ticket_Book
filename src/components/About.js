         <p>Cinema ticket is a voucher that indicates that an individual has the right or permission to watch a particular film or a movie for a given duration of time at a specific place. As a business process, cinema ticket is considered at the point of marketing or sales. One can buy a ticket from the box office or at the counter of an entertainment industry or an organization, which avails the tickets in the form of ticket checks or as separate. Tickets are also available from resellers, which are commercial enterprises that order tickets in the form of wholesale and reselling them to the consumers. Many customers trust dealers because of convenience and availability. The convenient factor relates to the local ticket acquisition while the availability factor is that all the tickets have been sold hence need to purchase the tickets from the resellers or not to see the particular performance of the show. Online booking of cinema tickets has been the current process of buying the tickets. Industries that have not developed the online system of ticket booking are therefore encouraged to adopt the system since it is effective and efficient regarding production, marketing, and customer satisfaction.
